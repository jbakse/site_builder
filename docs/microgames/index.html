<p>Minigames are small videogames included within larger videogames. They are often included as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">Easter eggs</a> or to add variety to the larger game. BioShock—a first-person shooter—used a minigame version of Pipe Dream—a classic puzzler—as the mechanic used to hack doors and machines. Final Fantasy 7 introduced a Chocobo Racing minigame that allowed players to capture, breed, and race large, rideable birds. In Animal Crossing, players can decorate their home with playable NES games.</p>
<p>Some games are made up almost entirely of minigames. Party games like Mario Party, Rayman: Raving Rabbids, and 1-2-Switch allow players to compete in a series of minigame events. Evoland I + II are RPGs that mix many videogame styles and mechanics both by including many minigames and by evolving the presentation of the main game itself.</p>

<p>Minigames provide many benefits in game design. They offer a change of pace from the main game, reducing fatigue. They are usually low stakes, reducing stress. A well-placed minigame can improve the pacing of the main game significantly. Offering a break before a spike in the action will increase the apparent contrast in the intensity.</p>
<p>Minigames don’t have to carry the weight of a full game. They don’t have advance the story or provide the amount of mechanics, levels, and content expected of full games. They are free to focus on a small set of ideas, deliver some fun gameplay, and move on.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_(franchise)">WarioWare</a> series, which debuted in 2003 on the Game Boy Advance, pushed the single-minded focus of minigames as far as possible. WarioWare presents the player with a rapid-fire sequence of microgames that demand only a single action from the player and take just seconds to play. As soon as the player completes one challenge, another begins.</p>

<p>Designing and building Microgames is a great way to explore game design. Their small scope allows even a single person to conceive, build, and test a game idea in a short amount of time. Each microgame is stripped to its essential element, allowing no distractions to cover up weak central mechanic. When building a microgame is left with a little to worry about as possible beyond the essentials of game design.</p>

<h2 id="approaching-libraries">Approaching Libraries</h2>
<p>The tools of creative technology change continuously. Computer hardware gets smaller, cheaper, and faster. New software is created and old software is updated. Those who work closely with technology need to continuously learn to use new tools to make new projects and maintain old ones.</p>
<p>Because being adept at learning new tools is a skill that supports many others, it is one of the most valuable skills to cultivate.</p>
<div id="" class="activity">
<h2 id="getting-started-with-new-tools">Getting Started with New Tools</h2>
<p>In this class, we have explored a number of libraries, languages, mediums, and tools. Reflect on your process for learning new tools.</p>
<h3 id="groups-5-minutes-3">Groups, 5 minutes</h3>
<p>Brainstorm at least 8 tactics for initially learning about a new tool.</p>
<h3 id="groups-10-minutes">Groups, 10 minutes</h3>
<p>Look at your list of tactics, group those that are similar, and write out a list of the 5 most important tactics. State each tactic clearly using fewer than 10 words.</p>
<h3 id="class-10-minutes-3">Class, 10 minutes</h3>
<p>Compare group lists.</p>
</div>
<br/>
Here are some of the key tactics I use when learning new tools:
<ul>
<li>Read the home page and feature overview.</li>
<li>Look through the examples. Focus on the library features that are demonstrated, not the code.</li>
<li>Scan the API reference. Note how it is organized and any interesting function names.</li>
<li>Create a “Hello, World!” from scratch or following a tutorial.</li>
<li>Look at the examples again. Read the code of an interesting example.</li>
<li>Modify the example.</li>
<li>Extend the example.</li>
<li>Build an original project of small scope.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="p5play">p5.play</h2>
<p>The p5.play library builds on p5.js to add features commonly needed in interactive applications, especially games. The p5.play homepage describes the library like this:</p>
<blockquote class="bigger">
<p>p5.play provides a <a href="http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=sprite.js" target="_blank">Sprite</a> class to manage visual objects in <a href="http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=sprite4.js" target="_blank">2D space</a> and features such as <a href="http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=sprite3.js" target="_blank">animation support</a>, <a href="http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=collisions.js" target="_blank">basic collision detection</a> and <a href="http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=collisions4.js" target="_blank">resolution</a>, sprite <a href="http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=sprite8.js" target="_blank">grouping</a>, helpers for mouse and keyboard <a href="http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=keyPresses.js" target="_blank">interactions</a>, and a <a href="http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=camera.js" target="_blank">virtual camera</a>. </p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since p5.play builds on p5.js it should feel pretty familiar. One key difference is that p5.play provides a scene graph. When you create a new sprite, p5.play remembers that it is part of the scene. When you set the velocity of a sprite, p5.play remembers that for you too. When you call <code>drawSprites()</code>, p5.play will move and draw all the sprites.</p>
