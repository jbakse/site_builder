## Homework Review

Review last week's class, this week's sketches, and this semester's class.

**Today's review is going to be different again today:**

- Get into groups of three.
- Review this weeks work.
- Consider your groups prompt in terms of the overall work.
- Don't select specific projects.
- Choose three specific "insights" related to your prompt to share with the class.
- Carefully phrase each insight in exactly 7 words.

**For example if your prompt was: "Inside vs Outside":**

- "Inside: darker at day, brighter at night."
- "Big things seem smaller when put outside."
- "People outside are going to other places."
