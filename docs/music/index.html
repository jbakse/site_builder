<p>Composers have long explored creating music with algorithms and chance. These works fall into a few rough categories.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Algorithmic Music</dt>
<dd>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition">algorithmic music</a>, an algorithm is employed <em>at the time of composition</em> resulting in a fixed score.</dd>
<dt>Aleatoric Music</dt>
<dd>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music">aleatoric music</a>, important aspects of a composition are intended to be decided <em>at the time of the performance</em>. Aleatoric music allows for variation according to the performer or chance within a specific structure. For example, a musical system published in 1792, <em>Anleitung zum Componieren von Walzern so viele man will vermittelst zweier Würfel, ohne etwas von der Musik oder Composition zu verstehen (Instructions for the composition of as many waltzes as one desires with two dice, without understanding anything about music or composition)</em> employed chance to arrange pre-composed measures of music.</dd>
<dt>Generative Music</dt>
<dd>Brian Eno used the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music">Generative Music</a> to describe music that is created by a system and that constantly changes.</dd>

<h2 id="generating-music">Generating Music</h2>
<p>This chapter covers some specific tactics for generating a short piece of music.</p>
<p>We’ll look at how to plan this project, the pieces that need to be built, and how to represent data. The final generator will be implemented in JavaScript using the Tone.js library.</p>
<p>Our result will be a simplified version of <a href="http://psam3060-d-s16.github.io/class_notes/week_9/sketch_music/">this demo</a>.</p>
<div id="" class="callout">
<p>The examples in the chapter originally used the p5.sound library. You can find information about building a synth with p5.sound <a href="./p5_sound.html">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="synthesizing-a-note">Synthesizing a Note</h2>
<p>Generating a melody isn’t much use if we can’t hear it. We could export our melody in an interchange format like MIDI, and play it back in an audio software package, but it will be more fun to build a synthesizer into our generator so we can hear the results right away. A synthesizer is a computer program or circuit that generates sounds. Synthesizers can simulate the sounds of natural instruments like pianos, guitars, and drums or create entirely new sounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer">Wikipedia: Synthesizer</a></p>
<div id="" class="discussion">
<h2 id="designing-the-synth">Designing the Synth</h2>
<p>Synthesizers create sounds. What kind of sound do we want to create?</p>
<p>Most synthesizers offer a great deal of customization through parameters. Adjusting these parameters allows you to create a wide range of sounds.</p>
<p>Compare the sounds of musical instruments—pianos, guitars, violins, drums. How are these sounds similar? How are they different? What synthesizer parameters do these differences suggest?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="timbre">Timbre</h3>
<p>When a note is played on different instruments—say a piano and guitar—the note will sound different even if it has the same pitch, length, and volume. Instruments sound different because of a variety of characteristics: spectral envelope; noisiness; attack, sustain, and decay; vibrato; tremolo; and others. Considered together these characteristics are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre">timbre</a> or tone.</p>
<p>One of the key contributors to the timbre of sounds created by a synthesizer is the shape of the generated wave. For example a sine wave has a clear, smooth sound and a square wave has a brassier, buzzier sound. Natural instruments produce varying overtones resulting in more complicated wave shapes.</p>
<p><img src="./images/wave_compare.png" alt="./images/wave_compare"></p>
<p>There are many ways to synthesize tones. Some of the most common are additive, subtractive, frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, wavetable, and sampled synthesis.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Additive Synthesis</dt>
<dd>Combine simple sine wave signals together to create complexity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series">Fourier theory</a> shows us that any periodic wave shape can be generated by adding sine waves of various frequencies and amplitudes.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="./images/wave_add.png" alt="./images/wave_compare"></p>
<dl>
<dt>Subtractive Synthesis</dt>
<dd>In subtractive synthesis a tone with rich overtones is filtered with frequency-pass filters that subtract different overtones to create new timbres. Square and sawtooth waves have strong overtones and are often used as the source in subtractive synthesis. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimoog">Minimoog</a> and other 1970’s synthesizers often used subtractive synthesis.</dd>
<dt>Wavetable Synthesis</dt>
<dd>In wavetable synthesis the wave isn’t generated with a periodic function or math. It is simply stored as data which is used by the synthesizer.</dd>
<dt>Sampled Synthesis</dt>
<dd>Sampled synthesis is a type of wavetable synthesis where the stored wave data is recorded from physical instruments.</dd>
<dt>FM and AM Synthesis</dt>
<dd>In FM and AM synthesis simple square, sine, or other oscillators are chained together. This allows one oscillator to change the frequency or amplitude of the other, usually at a rate higher than the fundamental frequency being played. This results in tremolo and vibrato effects.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="envelope">Envelope</h3>
<p>Another key contributer to the sound of an instrument is its amplitude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)">envelope</a>, which describes how the volume of the sound changes over time. A piano produces a sound that fades out over time, but an organ can hold a note at full volume indefinetely.</p>
<p>Synthesizes often let you control this aspect of the sound created using an <a href="https://www.wikiaudio.org/adsr-envelope/">ADSR envelope</a>. An ADSR envelope is shaped with four paremeters:</p>
<p><strong>Attack</strong> controlls how quickly the sound ramps up to full volume.</p>
<p><strong>Decay</strong> controls how quickly the sound then ramps down to its sustain level.</p>
<p><strong>Sustain</strong> controls how loud a held note is relative to the maximum volume reached by the attack.</p>
<p><strong>Release</strong> controls how long the sound takes to fade away when the note is no longer held.</p>
<p><img src="./images/adsr.png" alt="./images/wave_compare"></p>
<h3 id="tonejs">Tone.js</h3>
<p>The following exampes will use the Tone.js library to synthesize musical notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tone.js is a framework for creating interactive music in the browser. It provides advanced scheduling capabilities, synths and effects, and intuitive musical abstractions built on top of the Web Audio API.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li class="attrib"><a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js Homepage</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Tone.js is pretty easy to get started with and well documented. Be sure to read through the <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">overview</a>, browse the <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/">API docs</a>, and look at ALL the <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/examples/">examples</a>. By looking at the examples you will learn what the library can do, and you’ll also learn a fair amount about different synthesis techniques. At least you will learn the names of interesting techniques and common paramters. You can study the <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/tree/dev/examples">code for the examples</a> also. Finally, the <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki">Tone.js Wiki</a> has important conceptual information.</p>
<p>Jake Albaugh’s pretty cool <a href="https://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/full/qNrZyw/">Musical Chord Progression Arpeggiator</a> is created with Tone.js.</p>
<h4 id="tonejs-synths">Tone.js Synths</h4>
<p>The Tone.js library offers a several synthesizer options. The simplest one is <code>Tone.Synth()</code>. <code>Tone.Synth()</code> pairs an oscillator that generates a tone and an ADSR envelope that controls its volume. Even though this is a pretty simple synth, it can create a wide range of sounds.</p>

<h4 id="using-tonesynth">Using Tone.Synth()</h4>
<p>Using <code>Tone.Synth()</code> requires only a few lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="representing-playing-a-melody">Representing + Playing a Melody</h2>
<p>Now that we can play individual musical notes, we need to create some code to play a series of notes—a melody.</p>
<div id="" class="discussion">
<h2 id="what-does-a-melody-look-like">What does a Melody Look Like?</h2>
<p>A melody is a series of notes. What information is necessary to describe a melody? How would you represent that information in code?</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>triggerAttackRelease()</code> method lets us specify frequencies using musical notes, schedule notes to start a specific time, and last a specific duration. We can program a song like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">synth.triggerAttackRelease(<span class="hljs-string">"G4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"+0:0:0"</span>);
synth.triggerAttackRelease(<span class="hljs-string">"F#4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"+0:0:1"</span>);
synth.triggerAttackRelease(<span class="hljs-string">"D#4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"+0:0:2"</span>);
synth.triggerAttackRelease(<span class="hljs-string">"A3"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"+0:0:3"</span>);
synth.triggerAttackRelease(<span class="hljs-string">"G#3"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"+0:0:4"</span>);
synth.triggerAttackRelease(<span class="hljs-string">"E4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"+0:0:5"</span>);
synth.triggerAttackRelease(<span class="hljs-string">"G#4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"+0:0:6"</span>);
synth.triggerAttackRelease(<span class="hljs-string">"C5"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"+0:0:7"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>This plays a song, but the song is hard coded in commands. If we are going to generate a melody it will be helpful to have a data structure to represent it. That way we can build and manipulate the melody as data and play it when we are done.</p>
<h3 id="our-melody-format">Our Melody Format</h3>
<p>First lets figure out what we need, and what we don’t need. Our melody is a list of notes. Our synth is monophonic—we can’t play more than one note at a time—so we don’t need support for chords. Each note needs a <strong>pitch</strong> and each note needs a <strong>length</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="pitch">Pitch</h4>
<p>We could represent our pitch with the raw frequency in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz">hertz</a>: e.g. <code>261.63</code>.</p>
<p>We could use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation">scientific pitch notation</a>: e.g. <code>C4</code>.</p>
<p>We could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> note value: e.g. <code>60</code>.</p>
<p>Hertz is a little fussy, scientific pitch notation is good for humans but not computers (hard to manipulate with math), and MIDI notes are good for computers but not for humans.</p>

<p>Tone.js accepts frequencies and pitch notation directly and provides functions for working with MIDI.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">synth.triggerAttackRelease(<span class="hljs-number">55</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>);
synth.triggerAttackRelease(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>);
synth.triggerAttackRelease(Tone.Midi(<span class="hljs-number">33</span>), <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Tone.js also has functions for manipulating notes so they can be good for humans and still pretty good for computers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">Tone.Frequency(<span class="hljs-string">"A4"</span>).transpose(<span class="hljs-number">3</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//"C5"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>With that in mind, we’ll use scientific pitch notation in our data format.</p>
<h4 id="length">Length</h4>
<p>In musical notation, note lengths are usually provided in relation to the tempo and time signature of the piece: e.g. quarter notes, half notes. Tone.js has <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Time">shorthand notation</a> for this: <code>4n</code> -&gt; quarter note, <code>2n</code> -&gt; half note. We’ll use this notation as well.</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>Notes have two values: Pitch and Length. We could use an object <code>{pitch: 60, length: .25}</code> or an array <code>[60, .25]</code> to represent our note. The object is more <em>correct</em> but the array is more <em>compact</em>. For a short demo like this, I think a melody will look better with arrays: let’s use them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-.callout">Choosing to represent pitch and length in an array `[60, .25]` is semantically incorrect. The array implies a list of values with a similar nature. An object is better for a collection of values with different natures. With and array the code that accesses pitch will be unclear: `note[0]; note[1];`. With an object it would be much clearer: `note.pitch; note.length;`
</code></pre>
<h4 id="rests">Rests</h4>
<p>Rests are gaps between notes. They have a length, but no pitch. We could have a different format for rests, or we could use notes but set the pitch to a special value. For simplicity, let’s use notes with a special pitch value. We might use <code>0</code> or <code>undefined</code> to represent a rest, but those aren’t quite semantically correct. Since we can mix types in JavaScript we could use a string too: <code>rest</code>.</p>
<p>We could also encode the start time for each note and not include rests in our melody. If we did this though, we’d have to adjust the timing on everything when we add, remove, or move notes.</p>
<h4 id="our-format">Our Format</h4>
<p>Here is how our melody will look.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// mary had a little lamb</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> melody = [
  [<span class="hljs-string">"E4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"4n."</span>],
  [<span class="hljs-string">"D4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"8n"</span>],
  [<span class="hljs-string">"C4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"4n"</span>],
  [<span class="hljs-string">"D4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"4n"</span>],

  [<span class="hljs-string">"E4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"4n"</span>],
  [<span class="hljs-string">"E4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"4n"</span>],
  [<span class="hljs-string">"E4"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"4n"</span>],

  [<span class="hljs-string">"rest"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"1m"</span>]
];
</code></pre>
<h3 id="playing-our-melody-format">Playing our Melody Format</h3>
<p>Tone.js’s <code>triggerAttackRelease()</code> methods accept a parameters <code>duration</code> and <code>time</code> to notes in the future. To play back our melody, we can loop through each note and schedule it on the synth.</p>
<p>The example below shows how this can be done. It loops through the notes, schedules them, and then increments <code>t</code> to keep track of the accumulated time. It also shaves some time off of each note to create a slight stacatto effect. I think this sounds better on a monophonic synth then letting the notes butt up against each other.</p>

<h2 id="generating-a-melody">Generating a Melody</h2>
<p>Now we have a format to represent a melody and a function to play it. Our final challenge is the code to generate one. We can’t jump into coding yet: we need a plan that we can translate into code. You really can’t write computer code without first deciding exactly what you want the computer to do. You can try, but you’ll end up making decisions anyway. You’ll just make them as you go along, without a plan.</p>
<p>One approach we might consider is picking random notes and random lengths and placing them in a sequence. But that would be like generating images by randomly assigning colors to pixels: the result would be noise—in many senses. We don’t want noise, we want to make <em>music</em>.</p>
