## Pixels

Today, most computers use color displays that produce images using a grid of pixels. Conceptually, each pixel is made up of three sub-pixels—red, green, and blue—though the actual hardware may use a different pattern. Because these pixels are very close together, the image appears continuous. Because our eyes can only directly sense red, green, and blue light, the screen can reproduce most of the colors we are capable of seeing.

[Jasper St. Pierre: <br/>2D Rasterization](https://magcius.github.io/xplain/article/rast1.html)
/::

When you work with a graphics library like p5.js or the Javascript [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), you don't have to think about individual pixels. You can use high-level methods like `ellipse()` and `image()`, and the library will do the low-level work of setting individual pixel values for you. The process of converting shapes to pixels is called _rasterization_. Because the p5.js drawing calls handle the details of rasterization for you, you give up some control. When you draw a circle with `ellipse()` every pixel in the circle will be changed to the current `fill()` color. `ellipse()` provides no way to fill the ellipse with random colors, or a gradient, or colors generated by a function. To get this level of control, you need to take control of the rasterization yourself. This is the classic high-level/low-level trade-off. Coding at a low level takes more work but offers more control.

When you work at a high level you are not responsible for the details. Because you are not responsible for the details you tend to consider them less. Working directly with the pixels by reading and writing their red, green, and blue values one-by-one leads to thinking about drawing with code differently.

### Vector Monitors

Computer displays don't have to use pixels at all. One of the earliest video games, [Tennis for Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_for_Two), used a cathode ray oscilloscope as its display. In a cathode ray oscilloscope, signals are drawn by magnetically deflecting a beam of electrons as they race from an emitter—the cathode—towards a phosphor-coated glass screen. The phosphor glows where the electrons strike it, creating an image. This type of display can show smooth lines without any of the aliasing artifacts of a pixel display.

[Vector Monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_monitor) were used in later video games as well, including the [Tempest](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(video_game)>) arcade game and several games for the [Vectrex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex) home console.

### Video Memory

Modern video pipelines are fairly complicated, but at a basic level they work something like this: The red, green, and blue brightness values of every pixel on a display are stored in memory. This data is usually stored on the video card's VRAM. In simpler systems without dedicated VRAM this data is stored in the computer's main RAM. Once per refresh, the video hardware repeatedly reads through this data, pixel by pixel, and sends it to the display over a display interface like DVI or HDMI. Hardware in the display receives this data and updates the brightness of each pixel as needed. When you change the values in the RAM, a new picture appears on the screen.

::: .callout
A high-definition display is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 tall, for 345,600 total pixels. Each pixel needs three bytes to represent its color value: one byte each for the red, green, and blue channels. In total that is 6,220,800 bytes—about 6 megabytes—of memory to keep track of the full HD image.

Today, 6 megabytes isn't much, but many older computers didn't have enough RAM to keep a full-color image of the screen in memory at all. They used a [variety of tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfh0ytz8S0k) instead.
/::

### The Pixels Array

The memory storing the image shown on the screen is called the video buffer or framebuffer. Direct access to the screen's framebuffer is pretty unusual on modern computers, and high level libraries like p5.js don't (and can't) provide it. P5.js _does_ give you access to a pixel buffer storing the image shown on your sketch's canvas. When you call drawing functions like `rect()` and `ellipse()`, p5.js updates the appropriate values in this buffer. The buffer is then composited into the rendered webpage by the browser. The browser window is composited onto the display's framebuffer by the operating system and video hardware.

[p5.js<br/>pixels array](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pixels)
/::

You can read and write pixel values with the `get()` and `set()` methods. These methods are easy to use, but they are really, really slow. With a little bit of math, you can work directly with the `pixels` array data. This is a little more work but can easily be **thousands of times faster**.

<!--
Leah, I might come back to this section but i'm setting it aside for now to focus on getting everything else done. It might be helpful to talk over this together.

I want this section to look at the relationship between vector and raster images formats, to compare that to working with shape drawing vs pixels in p5.js, and talk about the conceptual differences and how they lead to different types of aesthetics. A key point is that vector's describe how to make an image, rasters describe the made image. Intent vs detail.

### Rasterization
[p5 rasterizes high-level descriptions to pixel values as you go (immediate mode?)]
[vector images are rasterized before they are shown]
### Raster vs. Vector Images
Raster and Vector images are conceptually very different.
Raster images are represented as samples
[How raster images are stored in memory]
[Not just about scalability. Scalability is the most often mentioned difference between raster and vector images, but other differences exist as well. Because vector images are described at a higher level—shapes instead of pixels—they are also easier to distort, recolor, change the stroke, etc. Not all images can be reasonably described as a collection of shapes. Photographic images, in particular, have too much detail to store as a collection of shapes. Similarly, some types of effects that consume or produce pixel-level detail require raster data, more information about what the images is made of, rather than what it looks like now]

## Writing Pixel Data

### A Basic Example

The p5.js library provides two ways to read and write image pixel data. First, you can use `get()` and `set()` which are a bit easier but slower. Second, you can access the `pixels[]` array directly, which is faster but requires some math to find the address of the pixel you want to work with.

This example uses `set()` to create some random pixel data.

::: js-lab
/pixels/sketches/basic_pixels.js
/::

Let's look at the code in depth.

This example doesn't write to the canvas pixels directly. Instead, it creates an empty image, writes to its pixels, and then draws the image to the canvas. This approach is more flexible and avoids the complexities of [pixelDensity](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pixelDensity).

Line 10
: Use `createImage()` to create a new, empty 10x10 image in memory. We can draw this image just like an image loaded from a `.jpg` or `.gif`.

Line 11
: Use `loadPixels()` to tell p5 that we want to access the pixels of the image for reading or writing. You must call `loadPixels()` before using `set()`, `get()`, or the `pixels[]` array.

Line 13
: Set up a nested loop. The inner content of the loop will be run once for every pixel.

Line 15
: Use the `color()` function to create a color value, which is assigned to `c`. Color values hold the R, G, B, and A values of a color. The color function takes into account the current `colorMode()`.

Line 16
: Use `set()` to set the color of the pixel at `x, y`.

Line 20
: Use `updatePixels()` to tell p5 we are done accessing the pixels of the image.

Line 22
: Use `noSmooth()` to tell p5 not to smooth the image when we scale it: we want it pixelated. This resembles Photoshop's 'nearest neighbor' scaling method.

Line 23
: Draw the image, scaling up so we can clearly see each pixel.

### Gradient Example

This example has the same structure as the first one, but draws a gradient pixel-by-pixel.

::: js-lab
/pixels/sketches/basic_pixels_2.js
/::

Line 15
: Instead of choosing a color at random, this example calculates a color based on the current `x` and `y` position of the pixel being set.

### Random Access Example

The first two examples use a nested loop to set a value for every pixel in the image. The loop visits every pixel in a sequential order. That tactic is commonly used in pixel generating and processing scripts, but not always. This example places red pixels at random places on the image.

2. Change the image resolution to `500x500`
3. Change the image resolution back to `10x10`
4. Make each pixel a random shade of blue.
5. Make each pixel a random shade of gray.

6. Make a horizontal black-to-blue gradient.
7. Make a vertical green-to-black gradient.
8. Make a horizontal white-to-blue gradient.
9. Make a vertical rainbow gradient. Tip: `colorMode()`
10. Create an inset square with a gradient, surrounded by randomly-colored pixels.
    {continue}

12. Instead of drawing single pixels, draw little `+` marks at random locations.
13. Make each `+` a random color.
    {continue}

17. Use `sin()` to create a repeating black-to-red-to-black color wave.
18. Create a `128x128` image and set the blue value of each pixel to `(y&x) * 16`
    {continue}

/::

## Reading + Processing Pixel Data

The p5.js library also allows you to read pixel data, so you can process images or use images as inputs. These examples use this low-res black-and-white image of Earth.

<img class="scale pixel" style="image-rendering: pixelated; height: 120px;" src="sketches/world.png" />

### Read Pixels Example 1

This example loads the image of Earth, loops over its pixels, and multiplies each pixel's color with a random color.

::: js-lab
/pixels/sketches/read_pixels_alt.js
/::

#### First we need to load an image to read pixel data from.

Line 3
: Declare a variable to hold our image.

Line 5
: The `preload()` function. Use this function to load assets. p5.js will wait until all assets are loaded before calling `setup()` and `draw()`

Line 6
: Load the image.

#### With our image loaded we can process the pixels.

Line 18
: Set up a nested loop to cover every pixel.

Line 20
: Use `get()` to load the color data of the current pixel. `get()` returns an array like `[255, 0, 0, 255]` with components for red, green, blue, and alpha.

Lines 22, 23, 24
: Read the red, blue, and green parts of the color.

Line 27
: Check if the red value is 255 to see if it is black or white. Since we know the image is only black and white this is enough to check.

Line 28 and Line 30
: Set `out_color` to red or blue.

Line 33
: Set the pixel's color to `out_color`.

Line 34
: Use `updatePixels()` to tell the image there has been an update. We didn't need to do this in the loop when we were just setting pixels, but here we mix `set()` and `get()`. p5.js requires calling `updatePixels()` anytime we switch from setting to getting or drawing.

::: .callout
Every time we switch from writing/setting to reading/getting, we have to call `updatePixels()`. This is because internally, p5.js will call `loadPixels()` when we call `get()` which will overwrite our changes in the pixel array. This extra updating and loading is why `get()` and `set()` are slower than accessing the `pixels[]` array directly.

### Read Pixels Example 2

This example compares each pixel to the one below it. If the upper pixel is darker, it is changed to magenta.

::: js-lab
/pixels/sketches/read_pixels_2.js

### Image as Input Example

This example doesn't draw the image at all. Instead, the image is used as an input that controls where the red ellipses are drawn. Using images as inputs is a powerful technique that allows you to mix manual art and procedurally-generated content.

### Modify Example 1

1. Make the program turn white pixels green.
2. Turn the black pixels to a random shade of red.
3. Turn the black pixels into a vertical, black-to-red gradient.
4. Comment out line 34 which calls `updatePixels()`. What happens?

<!-- <img src="sketches/world_100.png" style="image-rendering: pixelated;"> -->

### Modify Example 2

4. Change the `lightness()` comparison to `>`.
5. Change the `lightness()` comparison to `!=`.
6. Add an `else` block that changes the pixels to black.
   {continue}

### Modify Example 3

<img src="sketches/world_100.png" style="image-rendering: pixelated;">

8. Tell the program to use the image above by switching which `loadImage()` call is commented out in `preload()`.
9. Adjust the expression that determines `dot_size` to make the result prettier.
   {continue}

### Challenging Challenges

11. Start with the original Example 2 code, without your changes. Set `out_color` to the average of `this_color` and `below_color`. Here is an example you could follow:
    ```
    var color_a = color(worldImage.get(0, 1));
    var color_b = color(worldImage.get(0, 2));
    var blended_color = lerpColor(color_a, color_b, .5);
    ```
12. Change `worldImage.set(x, y, out_color);` to `worldImage.set(x, y+1, out_color);`.
13. Remove the `if` statement (but not its contents) so that its content always runs.
    {continue}

/::

## Working Directly with the `pixels[]` Array

### Performance

The built-in p5 `get()` function gets the RGBA values of a pixel in an image. Internally `get()` calls `loadPixels()` to make sure it is working with up-to-date information. This means that even when getting the values for a single pixel, _every_ pixel is read _every_ time. As noted in the [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/get), this makes `get()` slower than accessing the values in the `pixels[]` array directly. In fact, `get()` can easily be 1000s of times slower.

::: .callout

A `10 x 10` image has `100` pixels. Reading each pixel reloads all `100` pixel values. That means `10,000` pixel values are copied from the image into pixels[] array.

A `50 x 50` image has `2,500` pixels. Reading each pixel reloads all `2,500` pixels. That is `6,250,000` pixels copied.

A `1,920 x 1,080` image has `2,073,600` pixels. Reading all of those pixels with `get()` would require copying `4,299,816,960,000` pixels, but your browser will crash first.
/::

We can get much faster results by loading all of the pixel values **once** with `loadPixels()`, and then reading and writing the `pixels[]` array directly.

::: .callout
When reading from `pixels[]` ourselves we can make sure we haven't changed the values we are trying to read.

/::

The `getQuick()` function below reads a pixel's color value from an image's `pixels[]` array. You must call `loadPixels()` before calling this function. When you are done working with the `pixels[]` array, you should call `updatePixels()` to update the image with your changes.

```javascript
// returns the RGBA values of the pixel at x, y in the img's pixels[] array
// returns values as an array [r, g, b, a]
// use instead of p5s built in .get(x,y), for much better performance (more than 1000x better in many cases)
// see: http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pixels[]
// we don't need to worry about screen pixel density here, because we are not reading from the canvas

function getQuick(img, x, y) {
  var i = (y * img.width + x) * 4;
  return [
    testImage.pixels[i],
    testImage.pixels[i + 1],
    testImage.pixels[i + 2],
    testImage.pixels[i + 3]
  ];
}
```

Copy the `getQuick()` function above into your sketch. You can then replace a built-in p5 `get` call with a call to `getQuick`:

#### Using `get()`

```javascript
// in loop
c = img.get(x, y);
```

#### Using `getQuick()`

```javascript
// before loop
img.loadPixels();

// in loop
c = getQuick(img, x, y);

// after loop
img.updatePixels();
```

The following example compares the performance of using `get()` and `getQuick()` to read and invert the color value of a small image.

/pixels/sketches/performance.js
/::

### The Canvas + Pixel Density

You can work with the pixels in an image using `image.pixels[]` or the pixels of the canvas with just `pixels[]`.
When accessing the pixel data of the canvas itself, you need to consider the pixel density p5 is using. By default, p5 will create a high-dpi canvas when running on a high-dpi (retina) display. You can call `pixelDensity(1)` to disable this feature. Otherwise, you'll need to take into account the density when calculating a position in the `pixels[]` array.

The examples on this page work with the pixels of images instead of the canvas to avoid this issue altogether. If you need to work with the canvas, the [pixels](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pixels) documentation has info on working with higher pixel densities.

<!--
### Using the `pixels` array

The p5.js `pixels` array holds four color values—red, green, blue, and alpha—for every pixel on the canvas. Images are two dimensional, but the `pixels` array is one dimensional. In order to read or write values in the `pixels` array, you need to find the index—the position in the array—of your target pixel. To do that, you need to know how the data is laid out. In p5.js the upper left pixel is the first pixel in the array and the other pixels follow left to right, top to bottom. Each pixel is represented by four values: red, green, blue, and alpha.

```
[r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, r, g, b, a, ...]
 --- p1 ---  --- p2 ---  --- p3 ---  --- p4 ---  --- p5 ---  --- p6 ---
```

With data laid out like this we can find the index values as follows.

```
pixelNumber = y * imageWidth + x;
redIndex = pixelNumber * 4;
greenIndex = pixelNumber * 4 + 1;
blueIndex = pixelNumber * 4 + 2;
alphaIndex = pixelNumber * 4 + 3;
```

[[ diagram ]]

::: .callout .warn
On a high-dpi or retina display, the canvas array may have more values than you expect. When you call `createCanvas(512,512)` on a high pixel density display, p5.js actually creates a canvas that is 1024x1024, or potentially even larger if the display pixel density is very large.

### Pair Challenge — Generate / Process.

Work with a partner you haven't worked before.

1. Make a sketch that generates an image pixel by pixel.
2. Give your image to your partner.
3. Create a sketch that pixel processess that image.
