# Welcome Letter 2019

Hello Students!

Welcome to Computational Form, I'm looking forward to meeting you all (and seeing some of you again).


# You have Homework

Well, not much homework. Please read this email fully and do everything listed here **before the first class** to be fully prepared.


# Bookmark this Site
The class website is http://compform.net

This site will host the class calendar, syllabus, assignments, and lecture notes.


# Read the Syllabus
The Syllabus is on the class website. Read it now!

**Bring three questions about the syllabus, typed on paper, to the first class.**

These will count toward your "participation" grade! This can be an **easy A** or easy **0** to kick off your semester.


# Watch These Things
Watch these videos *before* class on Friday:

[How (and Why) Spelunky Makes its Own Levels | Game Maker's Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqk5Zf0tw3o)

[Digital Creatures Learn to cooperate | Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmYKfU5O_NA)


# Be on Time
The short version of my attendance policy:

**Attend every class, arrive early, stay late.**


# Be Prepared
Bring these things to Friday's class and to every class:

**laptop + a Comp Form sketchbook + red pen + black pen + pencil + camera/phone**
